This was the first prototype I sent littlebits for the Bleep Drum bit they were interested in making. 

All subsequent revisions were done on the bitlab github but unfortunately it looks like they have taken all that info down when production was canceled. 

The device was controlled by a single knob. When it was turned far to the left the incoming signal determined the sound sample and pitch. This allowed the micro sequencer bit to trigger all the sounds as shown at the start of this video

By turning the knob you could have the device be triggered by simple pulses with the knobs location determining the sample and pitch.
